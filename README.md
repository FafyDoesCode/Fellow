<p> Life is funny sometimes. When I was an intern for New York City Transit, both my supervisors were data scientists. Two Columbia graduates and I never spoke tech to them.</p>
<p>Luckily Linkedin is a great social media tool to network with data scientists and individuals in tech. Plus the website provides videos of data scientist learning tools. Glance at the courses by following this URL. https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/data-science.</p>

<p> If it wasn't for this Insta page https://www.instagram.com/theknowledgehouse/?hl=en that I follow, I wouldn't have know about the fellowship. </p>
<p> I always wanted to be scientist, now I get the chance to with this fellowship. <br>After going to the info session, I can't wait to progress in the selecting process and break into tech.</p>
