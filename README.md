<p> Life is funny sometimes. When I was an intern for New York City Transit, both my supervisors were data scientists. Two Columbia graduates and I never spoke tech to them. I thought it was strange, they sat all day at their computer listening in train noises. I didn't realize what they were doing at the time.</p>

<p>It wasn't until years later I put the "data" together. I still til this day I care about my video game files. Just creating the file and adding on my hours of game play. So it understandable that this field was created: To find patterns, analyze to those patterns and continue to build on this data.</p>

<p> If it wasn't for this Insta page https://www.instagram.com/theknowledgehouse/?hl=en that I follow, I wouldn't have know about the fellowship. </p>
<p> I always wanted to be scientist, now I get the chance to with this fellowship. <br>After going to the info session, I can't wait to progress in the selecting process and break into tech.</p>
