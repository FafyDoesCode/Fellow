<p> If it wasn't for this Insta page https://www.instagram.com/theknowledgehouse/?hl=en that I follow, I wouldn't have know about the fellowship. </p>

<p> I swear life is funny sometimes. When I was an intern for New York City Transit, both my supervisors were data scientists. Two Columbia graduates and I never spoke tech to them. I thought it was strange, they sat all day at their computer listening in train noises. I didn't realize what they were doing at the time.</p>

<p>It wasn't until years later I put the "data" together. Still til this day I care about my video game files. Just creating the file and adding on my hours to my previous content. So it understandable that this field was created: To find patterns, analyze to those patterns and continue to build on this data. Plus I always wanted to be a "scientist" during my previous college.</p>
